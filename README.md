# Grading and Policies
## Grading
The following grade scale will be used, after any curving takes place, based on class average as follows:

Percentage | Grade
--- | ---
89.5 - 100: | A
79.5 - 89.4: | B
69.5 - 79.4: | C
59.5 - 69.4: | D
< 59.5: | F

## Graded Items

Item | Percentage of Grade
--- | ---
Practicum 1 | %15
Practicum 2 | %15
Practicum 3 | %20
Assignments | %50 (5 percent each)

Late homework is not accepted as staff cannot hand out solutions or graded assignments until everyone has turned in their work.  Only in emergency or exceptional circumstances, such as a funeral or hospitalization, is late work accepted.  Personal scheduling issues like interviews, technology problems, etc. are not allowed as homework can be performed on any computer and can be submitted remotely.  

## Homework Style Guide
All written homework assignments are to be written in the [Markdown Syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).  

## Policies

All students should read the MSU Student Conduct Code.  

Due to the nature of this class and the skills being taught an additional ethics document will need to be signed and returned at the beginning of the second class for a student to continue enrollment in CSCI 491.  Unethical behaviour including cheating, plagiarism, unlawful access of computer systems, et al. will immediately result in a class failure and the incident will be reported to the Dean of Students.  

When it comes to homework assignments, you _MAY_:

* Work with other people on your team if allowed. 
* Share ideas with people in other teams
* Help other teams troubleshoot problems.
* Use the power of the Internet

You _MAY NOT_:

* Share code you write with other teams
* Submit code that someone on your team did not write.
* Modify another teams solution or code found online and claim it as your own.

Failure to abide by these rules will result in at "F" for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.  Please ask if you have any questions regarding your actions. In particular:

* Don't break University rules or laws. Examples of prohibited activities include network scanning, network exploitation, "testing" the security of a system without explicit permission from all necessary parties, etc.
* Don't attempt to hack the University.  You won't realize you're being watched until you're being sent to jail.

# General Course Knowledge Requirements
There are some basic competencies necessary to be successful in this course.  By no means must you be an expert in the following topics, but it would be useful to have a general familiarity.  A weekend review of the following topics will give you the basic tools to necessary to succeed.  

## Basic Computer Systems

* [Simple CPU](http://www.simplecpu.com/Binary.html)

## *Nix Knowledge
Linux is the most typically used *nix operating system in use today and will be the foundational tool for CSCI 476.  A familiarity with the Bash shell and Linux utilities can be gained from the following resources:

* [Linux Command](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)
* [Linux Tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)
* [Bash by Example](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-bash/index.html)
* [Shell-Fu](http://www.shell-fu.org/lister.php?top)
* [Explain Shell](http://explainshell.com/)
* [Kali Tools](http://tools.kali.org/tools-listing)

## Networking Knowledge

* [TCP/IP Illustrated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated)
* [IP Addressing and Subnetting for New Users](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html)
	
## Scripting Competency

* [Bash](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)
* [Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
* [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)

## Hardware and software requirements
Your primary platform will be [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org/downloads/).  You can use Kali as a native installation, in a virtual machine, or on a bootable usb.  If you are using a bootable usb ensure that you use it in persistence mode to ensure OS continuity.
